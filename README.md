# QuartoDocTools

[![Build Status](https://github.com/medyan-dev/QuartoDocTools.jl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/medyan-dev/QuartoDocTools.jl/actions)

An opinionated set of tools to help document large Julia packages with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)

This package doesn't aim to help integrate individual Quarto documents into an existing Documenter.jl generated site. 
Instead it helps integrate a Julia package's docstrings as part of a Quarto generated site.
