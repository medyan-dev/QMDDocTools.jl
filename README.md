# QMDDocTools

[![Build Status](https://github.com/medyan-dev/QMDDocTools.jl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/medyan-dev/QMDDocTools.jl/actions)

An opinionated set of tools to help document large Julia packages with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)

This package doesn't aim to help integrate individual Quarto documents into an existing Documenter.jl generated site. 
Instead it helps integrate a Julia package's docstrings as part of a Quarto generated site.

## Warning: QMDDocTools may be incompatible with a future release of Julia.

QMDDocTools uses a number of internal implementation details of the Julia documentation system.
These might break in a future release of Julia

## Julia functions

```julia
    gen_docstrings(pkgmodule::Module;
        outdir="",
        filterdocstr=checkpublicdocstr,
        docstringformatter=formatdoc2qmd,
    )
```

Generate the files that contain the docstrings of the input `pkgmodule`.
The files are written to the subdirectory "docstrings" in `outdir`
The previous subdirectory "docstrings" in `outdir` is deleted

Docstrings are included if defined in `pkgmodule` or its child modules.
Docstrings are not included if `filterdocstr(d::Docs.DocStr)` returns false.
Docstrings are formatted to quarto flavor markdown with `docstringformatter(d::Docs.DocStr)`.
Each public binding will have a file in "docstrings" with a filename of a transformed binding name ending in ".qmd".
Each source code file in the package that contains a public docstring will also have a file in "docstrings"
with the same name, but .jl replaced with .qmd.
The sections of the source code files will have identifiers matching the transformed binding names.

## `docref` filter

To link to the docstrings use the `docref` filter defined in `_extensions/docref/docref.lua`

This filter matches to any links with a `@ref` target. It is mostly compatible with `@ref` in julia flavored markdown, with a few differences, for one, it cannot be used to link to other sections. Use quarto's built-in features for that: see <https://quarto.org/docs/websites/index.html#linking>

Also, it is better to write the full binding, including all modules.

You can add a meta section defining CurrentModule to the top of a file.

For example:

```
---
CurrentModule: MEDYAN
---
```

Then if a binding referenced in the file doesn't have any periods, `MEDYAN.` in this example is prepended to the binding.

Source code file names shouldn't contain any # characters, or any characters that could be an issue being in a url.

See <https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/filters.html> for more info on using filters.

Here is an example `format` section of a `_quarto.yml` file.

```
format:
  html:
    filters:
      - docref.lua
      - quarto
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
```

Here are some examples of using the `docref` filter


## Just binding

``[`Base.:+`](@ref)``

## Binding and sig in one code block # separated

Note, sig is space sensitive.

``[`Base.:+#Tuple{MEDYAN.Context, Any}`](@ref)``

## Label with binding

``[test](@ref "#MEDYAN.Context")``

## Label with binding and sig in one code block # separated

``[test](@ref "#Base.:+#Tuple{MEDYAN.Context, Any}")``

## Label with src and binding

``[test](@ref "/docstrings/src/context.qmd#Base.:+")``
